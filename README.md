# Homework 1

This homework assignment covers the content that we discussed in class up until and including February 5.


### 1. Understand Markdown

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a language for simple text formatting. Usually, markdown files end in `.md` (like this file, `README.md`).

You will complete this homework assignment by modifying this Markdown file.

Take a look at these resources to understand Markdown basics:

Now, please edit this file by clicking on `README.md` in the list of files above, then click the pencil icon to edit it.


### 2. Setup GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a feature of GitHub that lets you serve webpages directly from a GitHub repository.

You will need to do this once for each homework assignment and class project.
